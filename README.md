Coronavirus data analysis in J.

Simple predictions using exponential regression and plot examples

## Data

### Illinois

I have collated data from the Illinois Department of Health into a `.csv` file
[here](https://github.com/vmchale/coronavirus/blob/master/illinois.csv).

It is arranged to be used from a columnar database; I use
[jd](https://www.jsoftware.com/jd_tuts.html).

## Use

First, install `graphics/plot`, `stats/base`, and `tables/csv`, viz.

```
  install 'graphics/plot'
  install 'tables/csv'
  install 'stats/base'
```
