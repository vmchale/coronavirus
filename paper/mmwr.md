Data were taken from Delphi COVIDCast (*1*) and analyzed with J (version 9.01;
Jsoftware). Masking data were taken from 10/04 and new cases were counted
over the 10/11-10/18 period (one week later) to account for delays in
diagnosis and testing.

Self-reports of wearing a mask were highly correlated with new cases the
following week (r = -0.75).
