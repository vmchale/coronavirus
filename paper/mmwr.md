# Summary

## What is already known about this topic?

SARS-CoV-2 can spread by airborne transmission; masks are known to filter
aerosols and particular masks are known to reduce risk of infection by
influenza.

## What is added by this report?

Wearing masks in accordance with current recommendations can slow transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

## What are the implications for public health practice?

Wearing masks should be emphasized.

# Introduction

Masks are widely used to protect from SARS-CoV-2 but to date research has
focused on how well certain masks filter aeorosols; choice of mask and
sloppiness while doffing are not accounted for.

By examining self-reported mask-wearing behavior and confirmed cases, we can
see how common recommendations fare in practice.

# Methods

Data were taken from Delphi COVIDCast (1) and analyzed with J (version 9.01;
Jsoftware). Masking data were taken from 10/04 and new cases were counted
over the 10/11-10/18 period (one week later) to account for delays in
diagnosis and testing.

Self-reports of wearing a mask were highly correlated with new cases the
following week (r = -0.75).
